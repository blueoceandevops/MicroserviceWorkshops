# Workshop Lab README

This folder contains setup instructions to set up ahead of my microservices workshop labs.
If you are just looking to learn how to set up an environment on any of the below platforms, you can also feel free to follow these setup steps but the labs themselves are only shared with attendees with the exception of the public labs produced for Microsoft by our team, which are now public domain as noted here.

> OVERVIEW:

In ALL, there are 5 different versions of the same lab. During specific workshops there may be a focus on a single platform, however given general interest in various platforms you do have the ability to try out the others as well. 

> NOTE: these labs are maintained based on demand for workshops so some may be more current than others, be aware that the steps do change and screenshots become out of date. Any lab actively delivered in a workshop, is up to date before that workshop :)

## Choose your platform for the workshop lab

If the workshop indicates several options for the lab time, you should choose which lab you will do.
If the workshop indicates ONE, then you should follow the instructions for only that one since the other labs may not be as up to date. 

Follow the setup steps to set up your environment. When the workshop is fully hands-on you want to do this BEFORE the workshop. Sometimes the labs are used for your own time given the content that needs to be covered.

Each workshop focuses on different platforms, and this will be indicated in the workshop link so that you know which labs to choose from. I check the relevant labs before a hands on workshop so the pace of "update" depends on the workshop activity. I keep each workshop indicating it's last "review" date.

Possible lab choices / environments:

* Azure Container Service (AKS) with Kubernetes
* AWS with EKS
* AWS with EC2 Container Services
* Google Cloud with Google Container Engine
* Azure Container Service with DC / OS
* Azure Service Fabric

> NOTE: for the AKS lab, it is now public domain so this site will guide you to the correct location to execute on the lab.

## Prerequisite setup steps

You must have the lab's setup steps completed before the lab period if you want to be productive during lab time.

Also, during the lab period, you will be given access to the actual lab instructions to follow.
You must follow the steps EXACTLY as written to avoid running into issues during lab time.

## Lab goals

When you get to the workshop.

A link to instructions describing the steps for each lab will be provided. You will be given some time to do work in the workshop but also to continue offline at your own pace.

The goal is to show similar deployments of a simple web app / api to a container platform whereby we go through the following:

1. Create and run the app
2. Dockerize the app and test locally
3. Deploy the application to a container platform
4. Work with load balancing, service discovery
5. Work with load testing, monitoring, scale out
